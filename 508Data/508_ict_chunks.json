This final rule is intended to, among other things, address advances in\r\n    information and communication technology that have occurred since the guidelines and standards were issued in 1998\r\n    and 2000 respectively, harmonize with accessibility standards developed by standards organizations worldwide in\r\n    recent years, and ensure consistency with the Board's regulations that have been promulgated since the late 1990s.\r\n    The Revised 508 Standards and 255 Guidelines support the access needs of individuals with disabilities, while also\r\n    taking into account the costs of providing accessible information and communication technology to Federal agencies,\r\n    as well as manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment.",

Appendix A\r\n    provides general application and scoping for Section 508, while Appendix B does likewise for Section 255. Appendix C\r\n    contains seven separate chapters setting forth the functional performance criteria and technical accessibility\r\n    standards that apply to both 508-covered and 255-covered ICT. These chapters are, generally speaking, broken down by\r\n    functional area (e.g., functional performance criteria, hardware, software, support documentation and services).\r\n    Lastly, Appendix D republishes the existing 508 Standards, which, as discussed below, may be needed to evaluate\r\n    Section 508-covered existing (legacy) ICT under the safe harbor provision.",

While the majority of the proposed requirements in the draft rule were not substantively changed\r\n    from the existing 508 Standards and 255 Guidelines, there were some notable proposed substantive revisions. Two of\r\n    the most significant were the proposals to require that Federal agencies make electronic content of specified\r\n    official communications accessible, and to harmonize with WCAG 2.0 by restating the Level AA Success Criteria and\r\n    Conformance Requirements in regulatory (mandatory) terms in the draft rule. Additionally, the 2010 ANPRM—in keeping\r\n    with the TEITAC Report—also sought to substantially update the structure and organization of the existing\r\n    regulations. In the draft rule, the proposed standards and guidelines shared a common set of functional performance\r\n    criteria (Chapter 2) and technical design criteria (Chapters 3-10), but had separate introductory chapters (Chapters\r\n    1 and 2), which outlined the respective scoping, application, and definitions for the revised 508 Standards and 255\r\n    Guidelines.",

However, many commenters expressed concern that the 2010 ANPRM was not\r\n    user-friendly, e.g., that it was too long (at close to 100 pages), organized in a confusing manner, and suffered\r\n    from some internal inconsistencies. For example, commenters noted confusion by virtue of the fact that some chapters\r\n    focused on functional features of accessibility while others addressed specific types of technology, or that the\r\n    meaning of \"ICT\" seemed to vary depending on the context of the specific chapter.

The Board acknowledged that, based on comments to the 2010 ANPRM, the draft rule needed to be\r\n    reorganized and made more concise. More importantly, we needed to obtain further comment on major issues and\r\n    harmonize with the European Commission's ICT standardization efforts that were already underway at that time.\r\n    Consequently, the Board issued a second Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (2011 ANPRM). See Advance Notice of\r\n    Proposed Rulemaking, 76 FR 76640 (proposed Dec. 8, 2011); Draft Updated Standards and Guidelines (2011), U.S. Access\r\n    Board, https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/draft-rule-2011. In the 2011 ANPRM, the Access Board substantially revamped the structure and organization of the draft rule. To\r\n    address comments criticizing the length and organization of the 2010 ANPRM as unwieldy, the revised draft rule\r\n    consolidated and streamlined provisions into six chapters (from ten), consolidated advisories, and reduced the page\r\n    count from close to 100 to less than 50. We also made revisions to improve the clarity of various proposed\r\n    provisions and ensure a consistent organizational structure throughout this draft rule. See, e.g., U.S. Access\r\n    Board, Information and Communication Technology Standards and Guidelines; Proposed Rule (NPRM), 80 FR 10880,\r\n    10884–93 (Feb. 27, 2015) (providing detailed comparison of 2010 and 2011 ANPRMs). Additionally, to address\r\n    commenters' collective concern that rephrasing of WCAG 2.0 requirements introduced ambiguities, the revised draft\r\n    rule proposed to apply WCAG 2.0's requirements through incorporation by reference rather than restating its\r\n    requirements in the technical provisions for Web and non-Web content, documents, and user applications.",

Characterizing refresh of the 508\r\n    Standards and 255 Guidelines as \"long overdue,\" these commenters urged the Access Board to issue its final rule as\r\n    expeditiously as possible. On substantive matters, a large number of commenters addressed some aspect of the\r\n    requirements for electronic content, with the bulk of these comments relating to Section 508-covered content.\r\n    Another technical area receiving sizeable comment was our proposal that, under both Sections 508 and 255, WCAG 2.0\r\n    and PDF/UA-1 serve as the referenced technical standards for accessibility of electronic content, hardware,\r\n    software, and support documentation and services. Additionally, real-time text (RTT) was a subject of great interest\r\n    to NPRM commenters, with most commenters representing disability advocacy organizations and academicians supporting\r\n    the Board's RTT proposal, while ITC manufacturers and trade groups expressed opposition. Further, the issue of\r\n    harmonization with EN 301 549 received considerable comment. In general, ITC industry-related commenters urged the\r\n    Board to harmonize more closely with this European specification. Disability advocacy organizations and\r\n    consumer-related commenters, on the other hand, viewed the proposed rule and EN 301 549 as well harmonized already\r\n    and expressed concern that further harmonization would be improvident because, in their view, EN 301 549 set forth\r\n    weaker accessibility requirements in some areas.",

The Board\r\n    acknowledges the challenges faced by individuals with electromagnetic sensitivities, and notes that electromagnetic\r\n    sensitivities may be considered a disability under the ADA if the sensitivity so severely impairs the neurological,\r\n    respiratory, or other functions of an individual that it substantially limits one or more of the individual's major\r\n    life activities. However, most of the accommodations suggested by these commenters are beyond the scope of this\r\n    rulemaking or our statutory jurisdiction. Moreover, none of our prior rulemaking notices (i.e., 2010 ANPRM, 2011\r\n    ANPRM, and NPRM) proposed technical specifications relating to electromagnetic sensitivities.

    "text": "For example, the final rule and EN 301 549 vary significantly in their respective levels of specificity of\r\n      technical requirements for ICT with closed functionality. In EN 301 549, the requirements for software with closed\r\n      functionality are a subset of the requirements for software that does not have closed functionality (compare,\r\n      e.g., EN 301 549 Clause 11.2.2 with EN 301 549 11.2.1) and, as such, they fail to offer technical criteria that\r\n      adequately and unambiguously address closed functionality. The only affirmative requirement for such ICT in EN 301\r\n      549 is that it be operable without the use of assistive technology (Clause 5.1.2.2), which is essentially the\r\n      definition of closed functionality. EN 301 549 does not require ICT with closed functionality to be speech output\r\n      enabled (cf. Clause 5.1.3.1), which is critical for persons with limited vision. The final rule, on the other\r\n      hand, affirmatively requires ICT with closed to have this critical functionality. See 402.2 (Speech-Output\r\n      Enabled).",
